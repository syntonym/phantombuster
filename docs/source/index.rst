PhantomBuster
=============

PhantomBuster is a bioinformatical tool that removes phantom barcode combinations that occur due to single-nucleotide sequencing errors and index hopping.
It is written for lineage-tracing experiments and CRISPR-screens, but can be used for any experimental setups in which only barcodes and no genetic DNA is measured.
